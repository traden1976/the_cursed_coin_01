            <h3>To whom it may concern,</h3>

            <p>I write this as a warning to any who may encounter <em>the coin</em>. It is not an ordinary object, nor should it be underestimated. The coin first came to my attention through a patient—an artist once of considerable renown—who arrived here after what his family described as a sudden and violent descent into madness. His obsession with the coin consumed him, and in the days before his commitment, he spoke of nothing else.</p>
            
            <p>During his time here, the artist became fixated on drawing the coin in extraordinary, unnerving detail. He whispered incessantly of an entity he called <em>Xylaroth</em>, claiming this being had forged the coin with the intent to grant power to those drawn by greed. The artist was certain that anyone who held the coin would gain the power to sway others, to form a following—one that would unwittingly serve this dark god, strengthening its reach into our world.</p>
            
            <p>The night he completed the drawing, he suffered a horrifying breakdown, gouging out his own eyes and leaving bloodied marks across the parchment. Since that night, he has wandered his cell, blind yet somehow compelled to trace small dots on the walls like constellations. He speaks only of vast, unseen realms, whispering that Xylaroth will <em>set him free</em>.</p>
            
            <p>The drawing of the coin has since vanished, but rumors persist that its mere likeness held a pull on those who viewed it. I urge you, if you should encounter <em>the coin</em>, to leave it be. Though it may promise riches and power, it will bring nothing but ruin. Heed this warning.</p>
            
            <p>Respectfully,</p>

            <p>I’m an unemployed Technical Artist who, being almost 50, sees the writing on the wall with AI and art as well as my part in the VFX industry. I understand and accept what’s happening, even if it’s a difficult shift.</p>

            <p>When I discovered meme coins and the community surrounding them, I felt an immediate connection. It’s not just about the humor; it’s about the story, the creativity, and the community built around them. I love how it brings people together with a shared sense of purpose and fun.</p>

            <p>I want to reconnect with my love of traditional art, even though it might feel like a step back in an era where AI is advancing so rapidly. For me, a huge part of art is the process itself—the tactile, hands-on journey that shapes each piece. This isn’t to downplay those who have embraced AI in their creative work, but I find myself nostalgic for a time when artists and illustrators had an unparalleled depth of knowledge and an unmatched skill in craftsmanship.</p>

            <p>It feels as though, with AI, the pursuit of true mastery in a craft is slipping away, and that loss is, to me, a significant one for humanity. We are makers, tool builders, creators by nature. But with the rise of these tools, I worry we’re heading toward a future where our roles as creators are diminished, where we risk becoming passive observers, like the humans in Wall-E. It’s a future I hope we can approach with caution, preserving the heart of what makes us human.<br><br>Below you'll find the sketches as "Proof of Humanity". Love.</p>
